This is a pen.
I saw a girl with a telescope.
This is a test sentence that anyone can change.
It is better than that.
We find joy in the simplest things.
It is easy to tell the depth of a well.
Kick the ball.
Slide the box into that empty space.
Men think and plan and sometimes act.
There is a pen.
